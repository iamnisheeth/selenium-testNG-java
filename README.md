# selenium-testNG-java

This is a barebone test automation framework written in java, built using gradle, uses Selenium for web automation, testNG for reporting and maintenance, 
log4j for logging.

This will eventually evolve itself into a robust TA framework with more add-ons and seamless integrations with other relevant open source tools.
